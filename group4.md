Entity Type - Salesman 

  We identified Salesman as a crucial entity in this database. In the real-world context, the Salesman entity could represent employees who interact directly with customers and handle product sales.

Attributes of the Salesman Entity

  After defining the entity, we listed its relevant attributes, which describe characteristics of the salesman, such as:  
  - Employee Name  
  - Contact Number  
  - Email  
  - Date of Birth  
  - Work Placement  
  - Branch ID (for the branch where the salesman works)  
  - Department Name (where the salesman is assigned)

Primary Key (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK)

  - We designated Employee_ID as the primary key (PK). This ensures that each salesman can be uniquely identified in the system.  
  - We also introduced two foreign keys (FK): Branch_ID and Department_Name. These foreign keys establish relationships between the Salesman entity and the Branch and Department entities, ensuring data consistency across related entities.

Entity Instances 

  To provide examples, we created two instances of the Salesman entity: 
  
  - Ridley Z. Barnes with Employee ID 00325650, working in the Electronics department at Branch 00127.  
  - Ryan C. Montero with Employee ID 00329869, working in the Cosmetics department, also at Branch 00127.

These instances represent real-world examples of salesmen, each with their own unique attributes while still sharing common fields like the branch and department.

Our ER diagram captures the relationships and key attributes of salesmen within the broader context of a company's organizational structure. By defining primary and foreign keys, we ensured data integrity and the ability to link entities seamlessly. Thank you, everyone.
